     Hello Hackers!

     I'm getting really excited about the upcoming meet-up, and hope that you
     are too!

     sign up here, now! $4

     If you really want to present, but don't have a project yet, make the best
     of this weekend! Make time to work on that nagging idea, you haven't yet
     made the time to work on! Or clean up and polish that old project of
     yours, and show it to us!

     If you have some ideas, that you'd like to discuss and need help with, use
     this mailing list!
